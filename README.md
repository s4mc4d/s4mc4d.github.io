## Welcome to my page !

I am building my own introduction page as a Python enthusiast and FEA (Finite Element Analysis) Simulation Engineer.

## FEA background

I have spent 7 years in the automotive industry as a Simulation Engineer. Calculating products resistance to vibration was part of my daily activity.

## Python dev

I have been using Python since 2011. This skill was a real asset in the Team, because it helped automate all manual operations regarding FEA job (meshing, assembling, applying boundary conditions, postprocessing), reducing hours of work to a few minutes or seconds.
